# Partner
Partner is a vanilla content API mod that adds a new card type to the game. In short, you can accept a partner to accompany you at the beginning of each game. Initially 16 base partners with hand-crafted pixel art are provided. You can also create your own partner by browsing the tutorial or viewing the Partner code.
